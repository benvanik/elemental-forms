IN PROGRESS

This is a heavy forking of [Turbo Badger](https://github.com/fruxo/turbobadger)
by [Emil Seger√•s](http://fiffigt.com). Emil did amazing work and came up with a
brilliant design and implementation that impressed me so much that I began
obsessing over it. This is my rendition of his work to turn it into the UI
system I'd been looking for.

The primary use of the library is for the [xenia](http://xenia.jp) emulator and
toolset, though contributions that make it more generally useful are welcome!

This may only be buildable from within the xenia repository, as it depends on
build configuration files present there.
TODO: find a way around that!
